Colonia Lite is a collection of over 190 mods with a mix of technology, magic, building + town management, and exploration. Built specifically for a public server previously hosted by Nebula Network. This version aims to deliver a lighter, more user friendly version of the Colonia Pack. We highly recommend you try the full version first if you are unsure if your system has the resources to play it, and then remove the client-side mods you don't want. 

- This Modpack is now retired. It will no longer receive updates unless we decide to open up a server.
- This Modpack has a full version! Visit its [repository](https://github.com/Carhenia/Colonia) for more information

These modifications include changes to various configuration files such as .toml, .cfg, .txt, .json, and others. These files have been modified to ensure that the modpack functions correctly and provides the desired gameplay experience.
